The plugin provides access to the standard interface that manages the editing and sending an email message. You can use
this view controller to display a standard email view inside your application and populate the fields of that view with
initial values, such as the subject, email recipients, body text, and attachments. The user can edit the initial
contents you specify and choose to send the email or cancel the operation.

Using this interface does not guarantee immediate delivery of the corresponding email message. The user may cancel the
creation of the message, and if the user does choose to send the message, the message is only queued in the Mail
application outbox. This allows you to generate emails even in situations where the user does not have network access,
such as in airplane mode. This interface does not provide a way for you to verify whether emails were actually
sent.<br><br>

## Supported Platforms

- __Android__
- __Browser__
- __iOS__
- __OSX__
- __Windows__

## Installation

The plugin can be installed via [Cordova-CLI][CLI] and is publicly available on [NPM][npm].

Execute from the projects root folder:

    $ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-email-composer

Or install a specific version:

    $ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-email-composer@VERSION

Or install the latest head version:

    $ cordova plugin add https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-email-composer.git

Or install from local source:

    $ cordova plugin add <path> --nofetch --nosave

## Usage

The plugin creates the object `cordova.plugins.email` and is accessible after the *deviceready* event has been fired.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('deviceready', function ()
{
    // cordova.plugins.email is now available
}, false);
```

### Open email composer

All properties are optional. After opening the draft the user may have the possibilities to edit the draft from the UI.

```javascript

cordova.plugins.email.open({
        /**
         * app to be used for email sending
         * @type {string | null}
         */
        app: null,
        /**
         * email addresses for TO field
         * @type {string | Array<string> | null}
         */
        to: null,
        /**
         * email addresses for CC field
         * @type {string | Array<string> | null}
         */
        cc: null,
        /**
         * email addresses for BCC field
         * @type {string | Array<string> | null}
         */
        bcc: null,
        /**
         * file paths or base64 data streams
         * @type {Array<string> | null}
         */
        attachments: null,
        /**
         * subject of the email
         * @type {string | null}
         */
        subject: null,
        /**
         * email body (for HTML, set isHtml to true)
         * @type {string | null}
         */
        body: null,
        /**
         *  indicates if the body is HTML or plain text
         *  @type {boolean | null}
         */
        isHtml: null,
    },
    /**
     * callback for email.open
     * @param {*} [error]
     * @void
     */
    function callback(error)
    {
        if(error)
            console.error("cannot open email", error);
        else
            console.log("email sucessfully opened");
    },
    /**
     * scope for callback
     * @type {*}
     */
    scope
);

```

The following example shows how to create and show an email draft pre-filled with different kind of properties:

```javascript
cordova.plugins.email.open({
    to: 'max@mustermann.de',
    cc: 'erika@mustermann.de',
    bcc: ['john@doe.com', 'jane@doe.com'],
    subject: 'Greetings',
    body: 'How are you? Nice greetings from Leipzig'
});
```

Of course its also possible to open a blank draft:

```javascript
cordova.plugins.email.open();
```
#### Specify email client

It's possible to specify the email client. If the device isnÂ´t able to handle the specified scheme it will fall back to
the system default:

```javascript
cordova.plugins.email.open({app: 'mailto', subject: 'Sent with mailto from my Cordov app'});
```

On __Android__ the app can be specified by either an alias or its package name. The alias _gmail_ is available by default.

```javascript
// Add app alias
cordova.plugins.email.addAlias('gmail', 'com.google.android.gm');

// Specify app by name or alias
cordova.plugins.email.open({app: 'gmail', subject: 'Sent from my Cordov Android app'});
```

On __Windows__ only predefined apps can be specified.

```javascript
/**
 * create mailto uri and pass it to the system launcher
 * - no attachments
 * - no html/css
 * - body length restricted by max uri length
 */
cordova.plugins.email.open({app: 'mailto', subject: 'Sent from my Cordova Windows app'});

/**
 * create eml file and pass it's file uri to the system launcher
 * - (currently) no attachments (yet)
 *
 */
cordova.plugins.email.open({app: 'emlFile', subject: 'Sent from my Cordova Windows app'});

/**
 * use the Windows.ApplicationModel.Email API to create draft and open email client
 * - cannot be used in store apps, as it requires enhanced app capabilities which would interfere with the microsoft store guidelines
 * - see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations
 *
 */
cordova.plugins.email.open({app: 'windowsEmail', subject: 'Sent from my Cordova Windows app'});
```

#### HTML and CSS

The built-in email app for iOS does support HTML and CSS. Some Android clients support rich formatted text. On Windows
Outlook supports HTML and CSS.

Use `isHtml` with caution! It's disabled by default.

#### Attach Base64 encoded content

The code below shows how to attach a base64 encoded image which will be added as an image with the name *icon.png*.

```javascript
cordova.plugins.email.open({
    subject: 'Cordova Icon',
    attachments: ['base64:icon.png//iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAADwAAAA8CAYAAAA6...']
});
```

#### Attach files from the device storage

The path to the files must be defined absolute from the root of the file system. On Android the user has to allow the
app first to read from external storage!

```javascript
cordova.plugins.email.open({
    attachments: 'file:///storage/sdcard/icon.png', //=> storage/sdcard/icon.png (Android)
});
```

#### Attach native app resources

Each app has a resource folder, e.g. the _res_ folder for Android apps or the _Resource_ folder for iOS apps. The
following example shows how to attach the app icon from within the app's resource folder.

```javascript
cordova.plugins.email.open({
    attachments: 'res://icon.png' //=> res/mipmap/icon (Android)
});
```

#### Attach assets from the www folder

The path to the files must be defined relative from the root of the mobile web app folder, which is located under the _
www_ folder.

```javascript
cordova.plugins.email.open({
    attachments: [
        'file://img/logo.png', //=> assets/www/img/logo.png (Android)
        'file://css/index.css' //=> www/css/index.css (iOS)
    ]
});
```

#### Attach files from the internal app file system

The path must be defined relative from the directory holding application files.

```javascript
cordova.plugins.email.open({
    attachments: [
        'app://databases/db.db3', //=> /data/data/<app.package>/databases/db.db3 (Android)
        'app://databases/db.db3', //=> /Applications/<AppName.app>/databases/db.db3 (iOS, OSX)
        'app://databases/db.db3', //=> ms-appdata:///databases/db.db3 (Windows)
    ]
});
```

### Device Configuration

The email service is only available on devices which have configured an email account. 
On __Android__ the user has to allow the app first to access account information.
On __Windows__ this returns always null as there is no api to detect email accounts.

```javascript
cordova.plugins.email.hasAccount(
    /**
     * @param {boolean | null} hasAccount
     */
    function (hasAccount){}
);
```

To check for a specific mail client, just pass its uri scheme on __iOS__, the package name on __Android__ 
or a predefined value on __Windows__ as first parameter:

```javascript
cordova.plugins.email.hasClient('gmail',
    /**
     * @param {boolean | null} hasClient
     */
    function (hasClient){}
);
```

For __Android__ only, it's possible to get a list of all installed email clients.
On __iOS__ and __Windows__ this returns always null.

```javascript
cordova.plugins.email.getClients(
    /**
     * @param {Array<string> | null} apps
     */
    function (apps)
    {
        console.log("available android apps", apps);
        cordova.plugins.email.open({app: apps[0]});
    }
);
```

## Permissions / Capabilities

### Android Permissions
Some functions require permissions on Android. The plugin itself does not add them to the manifest nor does it ask
for by itself at runtime.

| Permission | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `cordova.plugins.email.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` | Is needed to attach external files `file:///` located outside of the app's own file system. |
| `cordova.plugins.email.permission.READ_ACCOUNTS` | Without the permission the `hasAccount()` function wont be able to look for email accounts. |

To check if a permission has been granted:

```javascript
cordova.plugins.email.hasPermission(permission,
    /**
     * @param {boolean | null} hasPermission
     */
    function(hasPermission){
        console.log("android permission " + permission + (hasPermission ? " granted" : " not granted"));
    }
);
```

To request a permission:

```javascript
cordova.plugins.email.requestPermission(permission,
    /**
     * @param {boolean | null} permissionGranted
     */
    function(permissionGranted){
        console.log("android permission " + permission + (permissionGranted ? " granted" : " not granted"));
    }
);
```

__Note:__ The author of the app has to make sure that the permission is listed in the manifest. For Android you may
add the following lines to config.xml to achieve this:

```xml
<platform name="android">
    <config-file target="app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml" parent="/manifest"
                 xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS"/>
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS"/>
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
    </config-file>
</platform>
```

### Windows Capabilities

In order to use the [Windows.ApplicationModel.Email] API via `{app: "windowsEmail"}` the author of the app has to make 
sure that the capability is listed in the manifest. For Windows you may
add the following lines to config.xml to achieve this:

```xml
<platform name="windows">
    <config-file target="package.appxmanifest" parent="/Package/Capabilities"
                 xmlns:rescap="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10/restrictedcapabilities">
        <Capabilities>
            <rescap:Capability Name="email"/>
        </Capabilities>
    </config-file>
</platform>
```

__Warning from [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations):__ 
_The email restricted capability allows apps to read, triage, and send user emails.
This capability is required to use APIs in the Windows.ApplicationModel.Email namespace.
We don't recommend that you declare this capability in applications that you submit to the Microsoft Store. In most cases, the use of this capability won't be approved._ 

__Note:__ If you use the [Windows.ApplicationModel.Email] API via `{app: "windowsEmail"}` and did not specify
the required capabilities, your app may crash when opening the email composer.
